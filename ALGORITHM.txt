> forward loop through word

if letter:

-   can be first occurance -> in which case, create new builder for upcoming vowels
-   can be non-first occurance -> in which case, check if builder exists, and push existing builder into result array, then create new builder for upcoming vowels

if not letter & not last char of word:

-   check if builder exists, and append char to vowels key

if not letter & last char of word:

-   check if builder exists, and append char to vowels key, then push existing builder into result array

if letter & last char of word:

-   create new builder with vowels set as `null`, then push into result array
